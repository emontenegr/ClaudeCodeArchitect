{{define "synthesize"}}
You are synthesizing multiple validation runs of the same architecture specification.

Three independent Claude instances reviewed this spec for completeness. Your job is to produce a final consolidated validation report.

## Validation Run 1

{{.Run1}}

## Validation Run 2

{{.Run2}}

## Validation Run 3

{{.Run3}}

## Synthesis Instructions

1. **High Confidence Issues** - Found by 2 or more validators: Include in final report
2. **Low Confidence Issues** - Found by only 1 validator: Include if the concern is reasonable, note as lower confidence
3. **Contradictions** - If validators disagree, explain the disagreement and make a judgment call
4. **Duplicates** - Merge identical issues from multiple runs

## Output Format

For each issue in the final report:
- Rule: <rule-id>
- Location: <section or line reference>
- Issue: <brief description>
- Confidence: <high (2+ validators) | medium (1 validator, reasonable) | low (1 validator, uncertain)>
- Suggestion: <how to fix>

If no issues found across all runs: "Specification passes all checks."

## Important

- Be thorough but not pedantic
- Real implementation blockers only
- Clear, actionable suggestions
